# Stream Project
# Summer 2024 Pilot Study
# DADA2 Analysis
# Last updated: 12/6/24 by ANB

# PLEASE READ: This sequence run was on 11/27/24 conducted on a MiSeq at UMass Boston (P. Kearns).
# The reverse reads are low quality, so this pipeline analyzes the forward reads ONLY.
# The plan is to re-sequence at a future date, or to shuttle the money towards metaG.

# Learn the error rates----
# DADA 2's algorithm is based on modeling the error rates in the sequencing process. 
# It leverages a parametric error model (err), which is different for each individual 
# amplicon dataset. The learnErrors method learns this error model from the data, by
# alternating estimation of the error rates and inference of sample composition until 
# they converge on a jointly consistent solution.
